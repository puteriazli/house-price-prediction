# 🏠 House Price Prediction Web App (Indonesia)

This project is a simple **house price prediction system** built with **Machine Learning + Web Application**. The main goal is to help users estimate a fair house selling price based on location and basic property features.

I built this project as a **junior-level portfolio**, but with a mindset close to real industry use cases: data-driven decisions, clear business insight, and user-friendly implementation.

## Demo

## 🔍 Problem Background

In the property market, price estimation is often:
- Based on gut feeling or comparison with nearby listings
- Not consistent between agents or platforms
- Hard for normal users to validate

This creates risk for:
- **Sellers**: pricing too low or too high
- **Buyers**: paying above market value
- **Agents / platforms**: losing trust

This project tries to solve that by using historical data and machine learning to give **objective price estimation**.

---

## 💡 Business Insight

From a business perspective, this system can be useful for:

- **Property platforms** → price recommendation feature
- **Real estate agents** → faster and more consistent pricing
- **Individual sellers** → realistic expectation before selling

Key value:
- Reduce manual estimation time
- Improve pricing consistency
- Support decision-making with data

This model is **not meant to replace human judgment**, but to **support it with data**.

## ⚙️ Features

- House price prediction using Machine Learning
- Location-based input (Island → Province → City)
- Simple and clean web interface
- Real-time prediction result
- Backend API using Flask
- Frontend using React + Tailwind CSS

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Overview

- Problem type: **Regression**
- Target: House selling price
- Input features:
  - Location (Island, Province, City)
  - Land area
  - Building area

## 📊 Example Use Case

1. User selects location (Island, Province, City)
2. User inputs house details
3. System predicts estimated selling price
4. User uses result as reference for pricing decision

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Prediction accuracy depends on data quality
- Location granularity is still limited
- Market trends can change over time

This project is **a learning and portfolio project**, not a production-ready pricing engine.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Shows

- Understanding of end-to-end ML workflow
- Ability to connect ML model with web application
- Basic business thinking, not only technical
- Clean and structured implementation

As a fresh graduate, my focus is building **clear, understandable, and useful systems**, while continuously improving model quality and engineering practices.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add time-based market trends
- Improve location granularity
- Model explainability (feature importance / SHAP)
- User authentication and history
